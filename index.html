            <h3>Weapons</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                A weapon, arm, or armament is any device used with intent to inflict damage or harm to living creatures,
                structures, or systems. Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as
                hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare. In broader context, weapons may be construed to
                include anything used to gain a strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target.

            <h3>Carpets</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                The knotted pile carpet probably originated in the Caspian Sea area (Northern Iran) or the Armenian Highland.
                Although there is evidence of goats and sheep being sheared for wool and hair which was spun and woven as
                far back at the 7th millennium, the earliest surviving pile carpet is the "Pazyryk carpet", which dates from
                the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1949 from a Pazyryk burial mound in
                the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183 cm and framed by a border of griffins.

            <h3>Cult Objects</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                In the practice of religion, a cult image is a human-made object that is venerated or worshipped for the
                deity, spirit or daemon that it embodies or represents. Cultus, the outward religious formulas of "cult"
                (meaning religious practice, as opposed to the pejorative term for a potentially dangerous "new religion"),
                often centers upon the treatment of cult images, which may be dressed, fed or paraded, etc. Religious images
                cover a wider range of all types of images made with a religious purpose, subject, or connection.
                In many contexts "cult image" specifically means the most important image in a temple, kept in an inner space,
                as opposed to what may be many other images decorating the temple.

            <h3>Clocks</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                The first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper,
                were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device
                until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century
                allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these
                were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

            <h3>Jewels</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
                Jewellery (British English) or jewelry (American English) consists of small decorative items worn for
                personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants and bracelets.
                Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes, and the term is restricted to durable ornaments,
                excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often combined with gemstones, has been the normal
                material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used. It is one
                of the oldest type of archaeological artefact â€“ with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells
                thought to be the oldest known jewellery.
